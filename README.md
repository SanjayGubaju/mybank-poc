## Quick start - development mode
First start mybank-serverless application
```shell
cd mybank-serverless

```
Once the server has started an api-key will be generated and displayed in the command line:
i.e.: Key with token: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf812345

Copy that value to .env.development file before starting mybank-poc web application.

```shell
cd mybank-poc
npm run serve
```

### Production mode

```
serve -s dist -l 8888
```
